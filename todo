List in (somewhat) priority of things to do:

Delta Time / Vsync:
- [x] need to implement vsync and have time be consistent

Player movement:
- [x] kinetic energy; pressing the gas accelerates taxi
- [x] Taxi retains speed and drags through space, reducing speed
- [ ] advanced logic for handling reverse / break correctly.
(reverse/brake should be different buttons)

Camera:
- [x] move with Player
- [x] try to have it moderately smooth 
- [x] put image in the background for testing

Game draft:
- [ ] What do I actually want to build?
- [ ] What ideas do I have?
- [ ] I need to keep the scope of this game in check. Keep it small and don't let it blow up.

Mechanic Impls:
- [ ] Add crazy dashing

Quadtree / polygon collision detection:
- [ ] Big lift. Might be a lot of work.
- [ ] If linkedlists aren't straightforward, this'll fucking suck in my head.
- [ ] Question: Could we just brute force it? This'd be good to measure. Doing SAT collision detection will be more expensive than just AABB, so I'd imagine that SAT is desirable.
